# Fitting data in Python

I will present some examples to illustrate how to fit models to data using two different python modules:
 - `numpy.polynomial`: fit polynomials (power , Chebyshev, Legendre, Laguerre, and Hermite series)
 - `astropy.modeling`: a powerful  framework for representing models and performing model evaluation and fitting.
   A collection of 1D and 2D models are available; in addition, it is possible to define custom models.
